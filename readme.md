# Attendance System

## Project Overview

This project is an imaginary school system for managing student attendance. It includes a login page for users to authenticate and a home page for displaying a welcome message and providing a logout option. The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend, built with React and Vite, and the backend, built with Node.js and Express.
